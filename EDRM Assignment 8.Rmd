This is for EDRM 718 Assignment 8 in which we will practice writing scripts and
use the tidy verse package

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


This is developing a script
```{r}
Likert_Total <- function(x){
  CC <- rowSums(x)
  return(CC)
}
```


Load in data
```{r Loading in Data, include=FALSE}
HD <- read_csv("Howard's Data.csv")
HD
```



This is practicing that script with () data
```{r}
Howard_Data <- Likert_Total(HD[-1])
Howard_Data
```
