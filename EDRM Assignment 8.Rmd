This is for EDRM 718 Assignment 8 in which we will practice writing scripts and
use the tidy verse package

Load the package
```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


This is developing a script
```{r}
Likert_Total <- function(x,y,z){
  HD_Reversed <- abs(z-y)
  CC <- rowSums(x)
  return(HD_Reversed)
}
```


Load in data
```{r Loading in Data, include=FALSE}
HD_ugly <- read_csv("Howard's Data.csv")
HD <- HD_ugly[-1]
HD
```



This is practicing that script with () data
```{r}
Howard_Data <- Likert_Total(HD, 7, HD[,c(3,5,7)])
Howard_Data
```
